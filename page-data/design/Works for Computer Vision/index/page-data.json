For an example close to home: try retaining your patois/accent when your smart speaker â€“ the nearest thing to a cohabitant or even a carer â€“ wonâ€™t let you order food with it.\nThis series of works, still in progress, explores how we distort our communications so as to construct and relate to digital models of self.\nWhat are the social artifacts which arise from contorting ourselves to meet the gaze of the machine?</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7DCXltYyCHQ?si=vbOTJ8_tBzIQX2y0&amp;controls=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GyUpU0_-sd4?si=_BxtFYD3pPrkKVxo&amp;controls=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9ki9Wt7gn_8?si=dnkM3d_nhl9nsPdc&amp;controls=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>There are some other iterations of this piece which will be added soon, and I hope to keep this page as a kind of working document for the project ðŸ™‚\nSome important notes: the nature of the â€˜machineâ€™ in question has been discussed and well challenged to great length by the <a href=\"https://www.ajl.org\">Algorithmic Justice League</a>, as well as several other brilliant labs to numerant to namecheck here. There is, however, very little work investigating the harms and biases encoded and deployed in audio-based machine learning tools.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Works for Computer Vision","date":"Sunday, 1 October 2023","author":"Ash"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/design/Works for Computer Vision/index","breadcrumb":{"location":"/design/Works for Computer Vision/index/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/design","crumbLabel":"design"},{"pathname":"/design/Works for Computer Vision","crumbLabel":"Works for Computer Vision"},{"pathname":"/design/Works for Computer Vision/index","crumbLabel":"index"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
