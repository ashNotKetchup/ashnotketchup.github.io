MY LABOR OF LOVE AND FRUSTRATION.[^1]


The internet can be a beautiful place to share ideas. But these don't have to be neat or finished. This [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) is my personal experiment to cultivate ideas in a public space. 


This site is dedicated to both the formation and the formed. It may be different next time you visit.
