I'm currently obsessed with Daido Moriyama’s Half-Frames, in which he leverages the medium of half frame 35mm film to juxtapose subsequent images.

<!-- add examples here -->

I thought it might be interesting to explore something similar with **stereo algorithmic music**[^TM]. Performing different contexts simultaneously, bringing them in and out of dialogue with one another, exploring their (inter)subjectivity, and questioning the absurdity of context itself.

Here are some ideas with two algorithms. 


<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">

<div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
<p> Left is essentially <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p__meyer/" target="_blank">@p__meyer</a>‘s intra patch. <br></br>
</p>
</div>

<div style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
<p> Right is a variant of that which I made to implement Bresenham’s line algorithm in real-time. </p>
</div>

</div>
<br></br>

They’re being fed the exact same information, and controlling two instances of an FM synth (operator). What’s fun is that they are inverted - as intra becomes denser, the bresenhamians become sparser. Also feeding their position in the bar to pitch, and modulating their time unit with sine waves. 

They’re sometimes consonant, sometimes dissonant. Always fun, in any case.
