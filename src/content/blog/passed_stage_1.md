Every day, we see … new papers on the improved fidelity of generative ai models. These models entail huge amounts of unseen labour and environmental cost, and artists are increasingly alienated from their work. 

But what if we handed control of these models to these artists themselves?

My work seeks to explore the ways in which we can design interaction paradigms with AI audio systems which centre the data and the sound itself. Latent Spaces outlined in 2.3.2 are essentially the computational representation of the inside of a model. Using these, I hope to create new, useful ways of interacting with the disembodied but tangible object that is sound. critically rethink the system surrounding data and representations of data, supporting users’ control of how their data is used, and leveraging research for truly useful artistic tools. 


Last week, I presented my work on this topic, and I am pleased to share that I passed my phd upgrade with minor corrections. This means that I will continue my research with an eye towards my final thesis……

The key takeaways from the work so far include:
- Context and limitations of ai systems must be better communicated to users….
- agency….?
-

Immense thanks to my supervisory team @nick…and @charis….and @Anna…  As well as my colleagues at @the centre for digital music and @cci for the invaluable feedback!



So, I would like to propose the introduction of an ongoing reflexive and inter- textual account of the praxis of this research, tentatively titled: Music about tech and tech about music: on navigating the dual worlds of musician and de- signer in AI Music scholarship and praxis. This section will document aspects of the work which treads the line between practice and ‘design’ and therefore struggles to find a ‘neat’ contribution to scholarship. I think that this type of entangled reflection will bring an important dimensionality to the otherwise flattened account of the research, while also avoiding the fetishising of individual experience as an untouchable subjectivity which justifies poor design decisions.


🌟 Exciting News! 🌟

Every day, we see new papers on the improved fidelity of generative AI models. These advancements come with unseen labor and environmental costs, as well as the alienation of artists from their work. But what if we handed control of these models to the artists themselves?

My PhD research explores human AI partnerships for audio manipulation, in particular focussing on . By leveraging latent spaces, I aim to create new, useful ways for artists to interact with sound, rethink data systems, and empower users' control over their data.

I'm thrilled to share that last week, I passed my PhD upgrade with minor corrections. This means..... and will continue my research towards my final thesis. A huge thanks to my supervisory team @Nick, @Charis, and @Anna, as well as my colleagues at @TheCentreForDigitalMusic and @CCI for their invaluable feedback!

Key takeaways so far include the need for better communication of AI system contexts and limitations to users, and enhancing user agency.

A question I am constantly returning to during this research is:

How can I document/explicate the praxis of research at the intersection of ...

I propose introducing an ongoing reflexive account of my research, tentatively titled: "Music about Tech and Tech about Music: Navigating the Dual Worlds of Musician and Designer in AI Music Scholarship and Praxis." This will document the intersection of practice and design, adding depth and avoiding the fetishization of individual experiences.
