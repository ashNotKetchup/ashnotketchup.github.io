Between 2021 and 2023, I was a member of Indie/Electronic band Malady. 

## Live
Malady supported Sam Akpro, Swim Deep and Wet Leg, among others. We also played live shows at Fabric, SGW3, and more. I played drums/electronics, and (w/ Charlie Clark) provided musical direction for the band's live show.

## Studio
In 2022, Malady released 'Round the Bend' on Nice Swan (English Teacher, Jelly Cleaver, Prima Queen). The single recieved a [remix](https://niceswanrecords.bandcamp.com/track/round-the-bend) from Manchester legends 808 State. 

In early 2023, with support from [Modern Sky](https://www.modernsky.uk). Malady released 'All Pressure No Diamonds'. The EP was written and recorded together, first at Charlie's flat in East London, and then with Andy Savours (My Bloody Valentine, Black Country, New Road).

We also participated in ad campaigns with Fred Perry, Shure and Percival menswear.

## Leaving

In 2023, I decided to leave the band in order to focus on research and my own musical practice. The band in its current iteration constists of Charlie, Percy, Khaleem and a drum machine.
