  Gatsby Minimal Starter
</h1>

## Developing c4dm site:

1 - Clone repo (you'll need git or something for this)
2 - Install Node (you can use homebrew for this if you like, more info covered in the following: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-0/ )
3 - Navigate to the repo root folder, run npm install (this should add all the project dependencies to the local folder)
4 - Install Gatsby-cli globally (or run all Gatsby commands using npx â€“ tools like autonpx: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.auto-npx are great for this)

# New notes:
To add new pages with markdown, add them to the gatsby node query, as well as the appropriate folder. Then pick a template which they will load based off, and update that route in the bottom of the gatsby node
